# About pip's users

## Research

It is important to understand users' background, their cultural environment, and how they experience the world. To get this understanding we asked our participants about: their location in the world, their spoken language, if they identified as members of an underrepresented group in the Python community, and also to understand their disabilities and if they affected their usage of pip.

## Summary

164 participants took part in our "Who uses pip?” user research, 40% of these came from English speaking countries. 80% of participants came from Europe/North America.

Approx. 60% of participants did not identify as members of under-represented communities. The majority of those who did identify as under-represented did so for gender reasons.

The majority of participants (94%) responded that they did not have a disability. Those that did have a disability, the majority were cognitive disabilities (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism, Aspergers, Dyslexia) or a hearing disability.

## Recommendations

### Supporting languages other than English

The ideal situation to support non-English speaking pip users would be to translate documentation into their language, some alternatives could be drawn from the Python community:

#### Identify community members who could act as other language documentation stewards  

The Python community is global, and so has members who speak many languages. By identifying members who could take care of translating, or identifying already created documentation, this would help non-English speaking pip users.

#### Identify pip documentation in other languages and link to it from the official pip documentation

Our research has already found that users use a mixture of pip documentation, search engine searches, Stack Overflow and blogs/websites to find good documentation.

Providing a list of documentation in different languages for pip users would make it easier to find that documentation.

### Supporting pip users with disabilities

Pip's operation is actually very good for users with disabilities. Being a terminal application the user has a large amount of control on how they experience pip - customisation of interface visual preferences (to use contrasting colours, font size and type), there are no distracting images or ancillary content, they can use visual and auditory alerts.

#### Improving pip output

However the main improvement that should be made is to improve pips output.

Right now pip's output is too verbose - it generates an unhelpful amount of output during it's operation. This causes usability issues for all users - especially users with cognitive disabilities.

Pip's output should be improved by:

- Distinguishing what is important  information at the moment (e.g. at install of a package) and remove unimportant information from the terminal output. The information can still be logged to the log files if needed.
- Reduce the number of verbosity levels to 3. Right now there are 7 &lt;?> levels of verbosity.
    - Verbosity 0 - shows only what packages are to be installed, notifications identified as important about the operation, any errors and the final outcome
    - Verbosity 1 - shows more detail about the packages being installed
    - Verbosity 2 - shows full information which is also logged to logfiles

## Participant demographics

### Location

The majority of participation came from North American, Western European countries. Participation from African, Asian, and Middle-Eastern countries was low.

## Participant's first language

Even though the research was carried out mainly in English, 51% of participants spoke languages other than English.

NB: English includes British English and American English. Some participants gave more than 1 answer, their first answer is included here.


## Are you a member of an underrepresented minority in the Python users community?

We asked research participants if they identified as members of an underrepresented minority. We gave participants a broad definition of underrepresented - gender, age, educational background, language you speak, what you use Python for. The objective of this question was to discover participants' opinions of their understanding of underrepresented.

(This question was included _after _the survey was published. Total participants was 106, as opposed to all other questions which had 164)

![alt_text](images/image3.png "image_tooltip")

Of the 23.5% that responded "Yes" the answers were classified as follows :

### What do these results mean?

The majority of participants did not identify as part of an underrepresented community. Due to the small sample size these results cannot be seen as representative of the whole pip user base.


#### Participant comments about identifying/not identifying as under-represented

Here is a sample of noteworthy comments from these different groups.


##### Related to gender

_(I am) LGBTQ/IA+  - _Participant 242608909

_I am a 25 year old female Colombian developer. - _Participant 242611698

_Female, 39, no computer science background whatsoever, self taught. - _Participant 242614039


##### Related to culture

_The hispanic community is quite underrepresented in the web in general - Participant 242599212_

_I am a 1st generation Dominican-American. My parents are from the Dominican Republic. - _Participant 242769361


##### Age related

_Older age, I am 50 now. - _Participant 242769743


##### Neurodiversity related

_I'm a woman. And autistic. But the latter might not be underrepresented ;) - _Participant 243428773


##### Other

_Veterans who entered tech post-military _- Participant 243524784

_I'm not sure it applies, but I do feel that distributing CLI packages to workstations is painful with pip. I'm sure in server side environments where you have control over the host it's much easier. - _Participant 242943955

Noteworthy answers where the participant did not identify as under-represented (or were not sure) -

_I'm a young white cis male, so by far not a minority in those aspects. But at the same time I'm from a third world country, Argentina, and that sometimes (and I emphasize, only sometimes) makes me feel like a minority. When participating in our local communities (Python Argentina), I feel clearly not-minority, and with the responsibility of helping minorities, trying to build a more welcoming and fair environment for them. But when I participate in the broader global community, at times I feel underrepresented, seeing it mostly guided by english-seaking people from first world countries. But if I have to choose, I would say I mostly feel not-minority, because I mostly interact with people from our local communities, where I'm not part of a minority. - _Participant 242592869

_As a CIS male I conform the majoritarian group in the IT world. I'm hopeful that things are changing everywhere, and will keep changing: inclusion is getting bigger and better, more and more people are starting their careers as devs or similar, disregarding ethnicity and/or sexual orientation and that's great! And we need to keep fighting for that. - _Participant 243455292


## Participant disabilities

Disabilities - physical, motor, cognitive, hearing, speech - alter how people perceive and interact with the world around them - software included. We asked participants about their disabilities and how it affected their usage of pip.

Understanding these disabilities are important particularly when designing pip command structures, and designing pip output.

The majority of participants (150) responded that they did not have a disability. Those that did have a disability, the majority were cognitive disabilities (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism, Aspergers, Dyslexia) or a hearing disability.

![alt_text](images/image4.png "image_tooltip")



### Types of disabilities participants mentioned


#### Vision

Participants' who answered yes to this question were partially sighted. Their vision disability was not corrected by glasses however it did not significantly affect their usage of pip.


#### Hearing

5 participants identified as having a hearing impairment, or hearing loss. While this disability made participants lives more difficult, it did not affect their usage of pip:

_Being hard of hearing/impaired makes my life much harder, but so far it never has impacted my usage of pip. Perhaps because I haven‘t used parts of it that would? _- 242934019

_Not at all given that everything happens by text in my console._ - Participant 243455292

However it does affect the way they consume pip learning materials: if video is being used for learning or support, they should have captions/subtitles/transcriptions available.

_[...] any videos released, it is so helpful if there is either a) transcripts, or b) captions.  \
_- Participant 243524784

#### Cognitive disabilities

9 participants expressed cognitive disabilities including undefined mental health conditions, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism, Aspergers, Dyslexia.

These participants did not explain how their cognitive disabilities affect their usage of pip, however there are guidelines and best practices for designing for people with cognitive disabilities.

#### Physical or mobility disability

1 participant responded that they had a physical or mobility disability, but did not give detail about it in relation to their usage of pip.


## Use of assistive technology

Assistive technology is  

The majority of participants (94%) never used assistive technology equipment.  



<p id="gdcalert5" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image5.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert6">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image5.png "image_tooltip")


One participant (242933506) uses the following every day:

- Text-to-speech output as "text to speech it allow me to listen and learn when my eyes get strained.”
- Speech-to-text input as they like using their "tablet and makes typing easier”
- On-screen keyboards
- Input switches/touch screens


### I use it only when needed

7 participants use AT only as needed.

I use custom display filter software to do things like colorize key lines of output automatically (to draw my eye/attention), and provide digit dilimination (I.E. help me tell 1000 and 10000 apart) when using a text console application.

The standard Mac user interface design contains enough assistive technology without my needing to use any features which are specifically intended solely as assistive functions.

I sometimes use it to make sure that my code will work correctly with AT.


### How well do your Assistive Technologies work when you use pip?

For all participants who used AT, it worked very well for them, they did not report problems.

When using pip help pipe to unless more/less is used, output can scroll off top of the current terminal window - screen readers do not cope well in this case. The same can happen for installs and failed builds cause a lot of output, often with the critical part off the top of the screen.


### What operating system(s) are used with Assistive Technology?

Participants have used AT across 3 most popular desktop operating systems - Linux (most popular), Windows (2nd most popular), and Linux.

![alt_text](images/image6.png "image_tooltip")



### In your view, what is the most important accessibility improvement we should make to pip?



**AT setups**

Programmable ergonomic keyboard and a large easy-to-manipulate trackball (which pip doesn't need, being a CLI tool)

Software is a set of custom scripts I've written.

I have my custom keyboard between me and my screen, just like any typical user.

## Participant introduction to Python

The majority of participants were introduced to Python in school - second-level school, university, or postgraduate education.
