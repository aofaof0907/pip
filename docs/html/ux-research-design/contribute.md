# How to contribute

## Participate in UX research

It is important that we hear from pip users so that we can:
*   Understand how pip is currently used by the Python community
*   Understand how pip users _need_ pip to behave
*   Understand how pip users _would like_ pip to behave
*   Understand pip’s strengths and shortcomings
*   Make useful design recommendations for improving pip

If you are interested in participating in pip user research, please[ join pip’s user panel](https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/pip-ux-studies.python.org/).

## Test new features

You can help the team by testing new features as they are released to the community.

## Report and work on UX issues

If you believe that you have found a user experience bug in pip, or you have ideas for how pip could be made better for all users, please file an issue on the[ pip issue tracker](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/new).

You can also help improve pip’s user experience by[ working on UX issues](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22K%3A+UX%22). Issues that are ideal for new contributors are marked with “[good first issue](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)”. Explore the
